# Sprint 001 for Hut8 #

-> No images added. Just the Awkward Seal.
-> Low Responsivity.

This is the result of the first sprint given to us Trainees at Hut8 in april/2019.

Based on a given model I decided to let my good sense lead me on doing a static page with the theme RPG, wich I love.

There isn't that much of responsivity, as I didn't work on this topic that much and was pursuing a theme and aesthetics that looked more real. Although it came very different from anything I had seen so far.

Enjoy.
